# Hello!🤗 I'm DaonKang!
------

🌱 I’m currently learning Python, SQL, and Data Science.

🔬 I’m also exploring **AI-paper research** and building a foundation in **mathematics for AI**.

🎯 My goal is to become a capable **AI & Data Scientist** who codes, reasons mathematically, and communicates research clearly.

📚 I document my learning journey in my GitHub repositories — from algorithms to AI paper summaries.

💡 Always learning, always improving.
