# Hello!ðŸ¤— I'm DaonKang!
------

ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning **Python, SQL, and Data Science.**

ðŸ”¬ Iâ€™m also exploring **AI-paper research** and building a foundation in **mathematics for AI**.

ðŸŽ¯ My goal is to become a capable **AI & Data Scientist** who codes, reasons mathematically, and communicates research clearly.

ðŸ“š I document my learning journey in my GitHub repositories â€” from algorithms to AI paper summaries.

ðŸ’¡ Always learning, always improving.
